She must select conjuration for her implement mastery. Each time she gains an occultist level, a planar harmonizer can add one conjuration spell from the wizard spell list to her occultist spell list and her list of spells known. The planar harmonizer can’t choose a spell of a higher level than she is able to cast, and she adds the spell at the same spell level it appears on the wizard spell list. Additionally, she adds plane shift to her list as a 5th-level occultist spell. At 14th level, she doesn’t gain an additional school of implements. Instead, at 14th level, the DCs of saving throws to resist a planar harmonizer’s conjuration spells and conjuration focus powers increase by 2. All future implements that a planar harmonizer gains are common tuning forks.	DESC:This alters implements and implement mastery.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Planar Harmonizer ~ Conductor

Whenever she creates a magic circle, she can expend 1 additional point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of her implements) to focus the circle inward and lure that outsider to the circle (similar to using lesser planar binding).

Whenever he is on a plane that has an alignment or elemental trait, he can switch his attunement to match one of that plane’s traits as a standard action. After reducing an outsider to 0 hit points or below, he can switch his attunement to match one of that outsider’s subtypes as a free action.

If he attunes his grit pool to chaos, good, evil, or law, he gains resistance to magical effects that deal damage based on the chosen alignment, such as holy smite, order’s wrath, a paladin’s smite evil attack, or an unholy weapon. If he attunes his grit pool to air, earth, fire, or water, he gains protection against the energy type associated with that element (see infused bullet on page 6).

As long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, he gains the following benefits: if he infuses his bullets with an alignment, his bullet’s damage counts as that alignment for the purposes of overcoming DR; if he infuses his bullets with an element, half of his bullet’s damage changes to an energy type determined by the element infused: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire).

As a standard action, he can spend 3 grit points to shoot at a location within his firearm’s first range increment and tear a 10-foot-radius portal to a plane of his choice. The rift leads to a random location on the plane that is between 5 and 500 miles from his intended destination, as plane shift. The rift remains open for 1 minute, during which time any number of willing creatures can pass through. It is a one-way rift, and it is insufficiently stable to reveal details about the environment on the other side.

As a swift action, she can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir. For the next minute, her spells deal damage as if she had rolled exactly average on all of the dice, rounded down. To find the average, treat the arcanist as if she had rolled 2-1/2 on all d4s, 3-1/2 on all d6s, 4-1/2 on all d8s, 5-1/2 on all d10s, and 6-1/2 on all d12s.

She can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a swift action to gain the benefits of entropic shield for 1 minute and move 10 feet in a random direction. For the next minute, she moves 10 feet in a random direction at the end of each of her turns. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity or count against her movement for the round.
