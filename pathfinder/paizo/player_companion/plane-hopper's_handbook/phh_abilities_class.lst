Planar Rifter		KEY:Gunslinger Archetype ~ Planar Rifter		CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype		SOURCEPAGE:p.6		DESC:Followers of the daemonic harbinger Cixyron invented a method of harvesting pieces from Abaddon, absorbing some of the energy into themselves and condensing other portions of it into bullets they could fire from their guns. While these methods originated among Cixyron’s followers, they have spread among a few other seasoned planar travelers. Not all planar rifters are evil, as the same methods that proved effective in slaying the celestial host are just as useful against other planar forces.

When he uses his entropic touch ability, the chaos knight can grant the touched creature a blessing from the table below that lasts for %1 round(s). Only one creature can have this blessing at a time. If another creature gains the blessing, the previous blessing ends. The creature rolls 1d4 and compares the result to the table below to determine the blessing. If the chaos knight targets himself with the blessing, he can roll twice and choose his preferred result. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the chaos knight can grant a blessing to one additional creature at a time (currently %2 additional creatures).

Entropic Touch					KEY:Planar Harmonizer ~ Harmonic Shield				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Occultist Class Feature.Planar Harmonizer Class Feature.Special Quality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.7			DESC:At 4th level, a planar harmonizer learns to cloak herself in the essence of her home plane. She doesn’t take penalties on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based checks for being on a plane whose alignment traits clash with her own alignment.	DESC:At 7th level, At 7th level, she can expend 1 point of mental focus to gain the benefits of planar adaptation for %1|CL=Occultist|PRECLASS:1,Occultist=7	DESC:minutes.|PREMULT:2,[PRECLASS:1,Occultist=7],[PREVARLT:CL=Occultist,11]	DESC:hours.|PRECLASS:1,Occultist=11	DESC:This replaces shift focus and the focus power gained at 7th level.
Entropic Touch					KEY:Planar Harmonizer ~ Outside Messenger			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Occultist Class Feature.Planar Harmonizer Class Feature.Special Quality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.7			DESC:At 5th level, a planar harmonizer gains the magic circles class feature. Whenever she creates a magic circle, she can expend 1 additional point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of her implements) to focus the circle inward and lure that outsider to the circle (similar to using lesser planar binding). This functions as the outside contact occultist ability, except the information gained can be anything that might be learned through an augury spell. This alters magic circles and replaces aura sight and the focus power gained at 5th level.			ABILITY:Occultist Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Occultist ~ Magic Circles


###Block: Planar Rifter
Infused Grit					KEY:Planar Rifter ~ Infused Grit					CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Gunslinger Class Feature.Planar Rifter Class Feature.Special Quality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.6			DESC:Each day when a planar rifter recovers grit, he can attune his grit pool to one of the following subtypes: air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water. Whenever he is on a plane that has an alignment or elemental trait, he can switch his attunement to match one of that plane’s traits as a standard action. After reducing an outsider to 0 hit points or below, he can switch his attunement to match one of that outsider’s subtypes as a free action. He regains grit as normal from critical hits, but killing blows replenish his grit pool only if the target is an outsider. This alters grit.
Planar Resistance				KEY:Planar Rifter ~ Planar Resistance				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Gunslinger Class Feature.Planar Rifter Class Feature.Special Quality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.7			DESC:At 2nd level, when a planar rifter infuses his grit with the essence of a plane, he gains protection against that plane’s dangers. If he attunes his grit pool to chaos, good, evil, or law, he gains resistance to magical effects that deal damage based on the chosen alignment, such as holy smite, order’s wrath, a paladin’s smite evil attack, or an unholy weapon. If he attunes his grit pool to air, earth, fire, or water, he gains protection against the energy type associated with that element (see infused bullet on page 6). He reduces the amount of damage taken from attacks of the chosen type by 2 points per gunslinger level. This replaces nimble.
Planar Strike					KEY:Planar Rifter ~ Planar Strike					CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Gunslinger Class Feature.Planar Rifter Class Feature.Special Quality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DEFINE:PlanarStrikeExtraDice|0	DESC:At 5th level, as long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, a planar rifter’s weapon attacks deal an extra %1d6 points of damage of the same damage type reduced by his planar resistance. Aligned damage harms only creatures of an opposed alignment. This replaces gun training.|(1+PlanarStrikeExtraDice)	BONUS:VAR|PlanarStrikeExtraDice|1|PRECLASS:1,Gunslinger=13

#Deeds
Infused Bullet					KEY:Planar Rifter ~ Infused Bullet	SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL01	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL1.Supernatural													SOURCEPAGE:p.6			DESC:At 1st level, a planar rifter’s bullets carry the essence of a plane to which his grit pool is attuned, striking true against creatures that shrink from that plane’s nature. As long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, he gains the following benefits: if he infuses his bullets with an alignment, his bullet’s damage counts as that alignment for the purposes of overcoming DR; if he infuses his bullets with an element, half of his bullet’s damage changes to an energy type determined by the element infused: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire). This deed replaces the deadeye deed.	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds
Planar Surge					KEY:Planar Rifter ~ Planar Surge	SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL07	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL7.DeedsHasGritCost.Supernatural									SOURCEPAGE:p.7			DESC:At 7th level, a planar rifter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to change the attunement of his grit pool to any alignment or element. This new attunement remains for 1 minute, after which time the grit pool becomes unattuned. This deed replaces the dead shot deed.	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds
Breaching Shot					KEY:Planar Rifter ~ Breaching Shot	SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL15.DeedsHasGritCost.Supernatural								SOURCEPAGE:p.7			DESC:At 15th level, a planar rifter can fire bullets with such precision that he tears temporary rifts between planes. As a standard action, he can spend 3 grit points to shoot at a location within his firearm’s first range increment and tear a 10-foot-radius portal to a plane of his choice. The rift leads to a random location on the plane that is between 5 and 500 miles from his intended destination, as plane shift. The rift remains open for 1 minute, during which time any number of willing creatures can pass through. It is a one-way rift, and it is insufficiently stable to reveal details about the environment on the other side. This deed replaces the menacing shot deed.	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds
Banishing Shot					KEY:Planar Rifter ~ Banishing Shot	SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL19	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL19.DeedsHasGritCost.Supernatural								SOURCEPAGE:p.7			DESC:At 19th level, whenever a planar rifter confirms a critical hit against an extraplanar target, he can spend 1 grit to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC %1). On a failed saving throw, the target is returned to its original plane as per the banishment spell. This deed replaces the death’s shot deed.|(20+WIS)	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds
