#.MODing this to set up multiple times per day for Duskwalker Ghost Hunter feats
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Duskwalker ~ Ghost Hunter.MOD		DEFINE:DuskwalkerGhostHunterTimes|0			DESC:.CLEAR			DESC:DESC:In a duskwalker’s hands, any weapon can strike true against spectral beings. A duskwalker’s nonmagical weapons deal half damage to incorporeal creatures, as if they were magic weapons, and her magic weapons can deal critical hits and precision damage, even if they do not have the ghost touch property. %1 times per day as a standard action, a duskwalker can focus her natural revulsion toward undead. If she does so, she treats all weapons she wields as if they had the ghost touch property for 1 minute.|DuskwalkerGhostHunterTimes			BONUS:VAR|DuskwalkerGhostHunterTimes|1

Lavasoul (Magma Ifrit)				KEY:Ifrit Racial Subtype ~ Lavasoul			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ifrit Racial Subtype.SpecialQuality	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ifrit Racial Subtype ~ Lavasoul],[!PREFACT:1,ABILITIES,Ifrit_ReplaceSpellLikeAbility=true,Ifrit_ReplaceFireAffinity=true,Ifrit_ReplaceAbilityScores=true]							BONUS:STAT|CON,INT|2	BONUS:STAT|DEX|-2	DESC:Like the primal fires of creation, lavasoul ifrits are both fluid and fixed, alternating between stability and violent alteration. Mutable and intense, lavasouls evoke the cycle of creation and destruction in their colorful lives, unafraid to pursue new paradigms when the old ones no longer suit them. Many are dark-skinned but riven with blazing lines, which are sometimes also reflected in bright hair or eye colors. They tend to embrace body modification, acquiring and discarding tattoos and piercings as they feel appropriate. Lavasouls can be found in places where seismic change is commonplace and destructive creation is not seen as a contradiction.

With fire comes light, and the brightness of the sunsouls comes both from their affinity for positive energy and their own luminous attitudes. Where others despair, they labor on, striving to lead by example. Strong leaders and passionate ethos attract sunsouls, drawing them toward powerful religions or crusading nations. Sunsouls cannot easily hide their presence, and most would never try. Most sunsouls tend to have fair hair, often nearly white, and eyes that glow with a twinkle all their own. Some seem to glow from within, as if lit from inside by an inner sunlight. Unafraid to be seen, they dress in whatever styles please them, even when it means they stand out among populations either more daring or more conservative.

Gemsouls tend to have large egos and are flashy in their relationships. They gravitate towards artistic pursuits, most frequently of a performative nature, though they also have a strong tradition of symmetric poetry. Gemsouls prefer to make their homes in flamboyant societies or places where they can make meaningful personal contributions, as well as in nations that appreciate cultivated beauty. Gemsouls typically have dazzling, faceted skin, along with a cluster of crystalline formations instead of hair and pupil-less eyes of vivid colors. Some favor tattoos in complex, branching geometric shapes, and they can frequently be seen wearing silks or brightly dyed linen to contrast their complexions.

Possessed of patience and a sense of self-refinement through struggle, ironsouls reflect their ancestry in their continuous and determined efforts towards self-improvement. Ironsouls are most at home in areas that reflect that same sense of directed and intentional growth, and they operate best within existing formal structures. Ironsouls wear their elemental heritage on their skin, with most having some amount of metallic sheen. Their skin tone varies, with colors ranging from gold and silver to copper-green and dull, oxide gray.

Obfuscation, secrecy, and the shape of things not there: all these are the natural realms of smokesouls. They are experts at concealing both their bodies and motivations, and at making the insubstantial seem as real as any physical object. Smokesouls are drawn to areas of dangerous politics and intrigue, and many can be found pursuing whatever machinations amuse them. With few distinguishing features save ashen skin and dark hair, smokesouls can be mistaken for any number of other races. Smokesouls often change their clothing, cosmetics, or style to keep their appearance in a constant state of flux.

When a stormsoul moves, either in word or in action, the world notices. Unafraid to speak their minds, they are both direct and unsubtle, and they make fierce allies. When friends are in need, stormsouls act without thinking and are always the first to leap to their aid. A stormsoul sylph has hair that always seems to move, even when there is no breeze, and acts with a sudden intensity that can seem out of control. Their eyes are the color of stormy water or lightning-lit skies, and even a casual glance from a stormsoul can seem severe.

CATEGORY=Special Ability|Spiritualist ~ Etheric Tether.MOD			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Favored Class Bonus ~ Spiritualist ~ Shabti			DEFINE:EthericTetherRange|0																DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:At 1st level, a spiritualist can force the phantom to manifest in an area around her by pushing the phantom's consciousness though the veil of ethereal essence, allowing it to fully manifest in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. Whenever her manifested phantom takes enough damage to send it back to the Ethereal Plane, as a reaction to the damage, the spiritualist can sacrifice any number of her hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the phantom. This can prevent the phantom from being sent back to the Ethereal Plane. This tether is limited. When the phantom is fully manifested, it and the spiritualist must remain within %1 feet of one another for the phantom's manifestation to stay stable with little to no concentration on the part of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can stretch the limited tether, but only when the phantom is in ectoplasmic form. When a spiritualist starts her turn and her ectoplasmic phantom is more than %1 feet away from her (but closer than 100 feet), the spiritualist must concentrate on the link as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity or the ectoplasmic phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and cannot be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. This concentration can be interrupted as if it were a spell. Treat this effect's spell level as equal to 1 + 1 per 10 feet farther than 50 feet that the phantom is from the spiritualist (maximum spell level 6th). If the tether is interrupted or the check fails, the phantom immediately snaps back into the consciousness of its spiritualist master. If the ectoplasmic phantom is ever more than 100 feet away from its spiritualist, or the incorporeal phantom is ever 50 feet away from the spiritualist or outside of line of effect from the spiritualist for more than 1 round per spiritualist level the spiritualist possesses, the tether is automatically broken; the phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and can't be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.|EthericTetherRange		BONUS:VAR|EthericTetherRange|50
