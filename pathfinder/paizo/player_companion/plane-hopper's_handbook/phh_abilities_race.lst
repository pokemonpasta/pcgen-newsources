###Block: Ifrit
Lavasoul (Magma Ifrit)				KEY:Ifrit Racial Subtype ~ Lavasoul			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ifrit Racial Subtype.SpecialQuality	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ifrit Racial Subtype ~ Lavasoul],[!PREFACT:1,ABILITIES,Ifrit_ReplaceSpellLikeAbility=true,Ifrit_ReplaceFireAffinity=true,Ifrit_ReplaceAbilityScores=true]							BONUS:STAT|CON,INT|2	BONUS:STAT|DEX|-2	DESC:Like the primal fires of creation, lavasoul ifrits are both fluid and fixed, alternating between stability and violent alteration. Mutable and intense, lavasouls evoke the cycle of creation and destruction in their colorful lives, unafraid to pursue new paradigms when the old ones no longer suit them. Many are dark-skinned but riven with blazing lines, which are sometimes also reflected in bright hair or eye colors. They tend to embrace body modification, acquiring and discarding tattoos and piercings as they feel appropriate. Lavasouls can be found in places where seismic change is commonplace and destructive creation is not seen as a contradiction.

With fire comes light, and the brightness of the sunsouls comes both from their affinity for positive energy and their own luminous attitudes. Where others despair, they labor on, striving to lead by example. Strong leaders and passionate ethos attract sunsouls, drawing them toward powerful religions or crusading nations. Sunsouls cannot easily hide their presence, and most would never try. Most sunsouls tend to have fair hair, often nearly white, and eyes that glow with a twinkle all their own. Some seem to glow from within, as if lit from inside by an inner sunlight. Unafraid to be seen, they dress in whatever styles please them, even when it means they stand out among populations either more daring or more conservative.

Gemsouls tend to have large egos and are flashy in their relationships. They gravitate towards artistic pursuits, most frequently of a performative nature, though they also have a strong tradition of symmetric poetry. Gemsouls prefer to make their homes in flamboyant societies or places where they can make meaningful personal contributions, as well as in nations that appreciate cultivated beauty. Gemsouls typically have dazzling, faceted skin, along with a cluster of crystalline formations instead of hair and pupil-less eyes of vivid colors. Some favor tattoos in complex, branching geometric shapes, and they can frequently be seen wearing silks or brightly dyed linen to contrast their complexions.

Possessed of patience and a sense of self-refinement through struggle, ironsouls reflect their ancestry in their continuous and determined efforts towards self-improvement. Ironsouls are most at home in areas that reflect that same sense of directed and intentional growth, and they operate best within existing formal structures. Ironsouls wear their elemental heritage on their skin, with most having some amount of metallic sheen. Their skin tone varies, with colors ranging from gold and silver to copper-green and dull, oxide gray.

Obfuscation, secrecy, and the shape of things not there: all these are the natural realms of smokesouls. They are experts at concealing both their bodies and motivations, and at making the insubstantial seem as real as any physical object. Smokesouls are drawn to areas of dangerous politics and intrigue, and many can be found pursuing whatever machinations amuse them. With few distinguishing features save ashen skin and dark hair, smokesouls can be mistaken for any number of other races. Smokesouls often change their clothing, cosmetics, or style to keep their appearance in a constant state of flux.

When a stormsoul moves, either in word or in action, the world notices. Unafraid to speak their minds, they are both direct and unsubtle, and they make fierce allies. When friends are in need, stormsouls act without thinking and are always the first to leap to their aid. A stormsoul sylph has hair that always seems to move, even when there is no breeze, and acts with a sudden intensity that can seem out of control. Their eyes are the color of stormy water or lightning-lit skies, and even a casual glance from a stormsoul can seem severe.

They tend to seek out places where ideological and political struggles converge. Physically, mistsouls have rounded features and graceful deliberation in their movement.

Rimesouls often choose to live in sparsely populated areas. When they do live in cities, they prefer areas of disciplined culture.
