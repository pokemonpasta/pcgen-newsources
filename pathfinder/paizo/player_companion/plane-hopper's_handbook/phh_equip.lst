###Block: Planar Power Components
Cooperation Crystal			KEY:Cooperation Crystal			SORTKEY:Cooperation Crystal			TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable			COST:300	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.10			DESC:This vibrant blue-green crystal is a distillation of the spirit of cooperation characteristic of the chaotic good plane of Elysium. When you use a cooperation crystal as a material component or focus for a harmless spell, treat your caster level as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the spell’s duration and effect. This increase doesn’t stack with other effects that raise the caster level of a spell.
Fire Fragment				KEY:Fire Fragment				SORTKEY:Fire Fragment				TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable			COST:350	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.10			DESC:This small, reddish crystal shard flickers with a brilliant, dancing flame — a representation of the Plane of Fire. When you use a fire fragment as a material component or focus for a spell that deals fire damage, that spell is affected as per the Flaring Spell metamagic feat (though this does not increase the spell slot that the spell uses), and you treat your caster level as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the spell’s damage.
Heavenly Quartz				KEY:Heavenly Quartz				SORTKEY:Heavenly Quartz				TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable			COST:250	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.11			DESC:This fragment appears to be made of glass and gold and emits gleaming light, reminiscent of the mountain of Heaven. When you use a Heavenly quartz as a material component or focus for a spell with the good or lawful descriptor that requires affected creatures to attempt a Will saving throw, increase the DC of that saving throw by 1; if the spell has both the good and lawful descriptors, treat the spell’s caster level as if it were 1 higher for the purpose of caster level checks and dispel checks.
Void Shard					KEY:Void Shard					SORTKEY:Void Shard					TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable			COST:250	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.11			DESC:This shard seems to absorb the light around it, demonstrating the annihilatory power of the Negative Energy Plane. When you use a void crystal as a material component or focus for a spell of the necromancy school, the target takes a –2 penalty on saves against the spell.
Whimsy Star					KEY:Whimsy Star					SORTKEY:Whimsy Star					TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable			COST:200	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.11			DESC:The shimmering, multicolored whimsy star captures the mutability of the First World. When you use a whimsy star as a material component or focus for a spell, roll 1d6 and consult the table below. You can’t use magic or other abilities to affect the result of this roll. If a result cannot apply to your spell, then the spell resolves normally. Regardless of the result, the spell slot required to cast the spell doesn’t change. &nl; 1: The spell fails and you are dazzled for 1d4 rounds. &nl; 2: The spell resolves normally. &nl; 3: The spell is affected as per the Enlarge Spell metamagic feat. &nl; 4: The spell is affected as per the Extend Spell metamagic feat. &nl; 5: The spell is affected as per the Widen Spell metamagic feat. &nl; 6: The spell is affected as per the Heighten Spell metamagic feat, increasing the spell’s level by 1.

###Block: Planar Vehicle
Planar Carriage				KEY:Planar Carriage				SORTKEY:Planar Carriage				TYPE:Goods.Transportation.Vehicle.Container	COST:121500	WT:1500	SOURCEPAGE:p.11			DESC:Planar carriages are large metal-and-wood vehicles painted or styled to reflect the appearance of a certain plane. When not being used to travel to another plane, a planar carriage functions as a heavy wagon, except for the following changes: instead of muscle propulsion, a planar carriage has built-in magic propulsion that requires a driver to use Spellcraft or Use Magic Device for driving checks. A planar carriage has a maximum speed of 90 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet. Its driving device is a magic item (a 5-foot magical sphere) that occupies the forwardmost square, and its driving space consists of the squares adjacent to the device. &nl; Once per day, the driver of a planar carriage can attempt to transport the carriage and its occupants to a plane of her choosing other than the plane that the carriage is currently on. For the driver to do so, the vehicle must be moving at its maximum speed. While the carriage is moving at maximum speed, the driver can attempt a DC 20 Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check to open a gate in front of the planar carriage to the chosen plane, as per the gate spell, and drive the carriage into the gate. If the driver designates a specific arrival point on the target plane, the carriage arrives at that exact location; otherwise, the carriage appears in a random location on the plane appropriate for the carriage’s size. &nl; When the carriage arrives on another plane, it grants its occupants the benefits of planar adaptation for that plane as long as the occupants remain within the carriage; the carriage itself also gains those benefits. A planar carriage can grant the benefits of planar adaptation for only one plane at a time, so when the carriage moves to a different plane, the benefits from planar adaptation change accordingly. Occupants who are native to the plane the planar carriage is on do not gain any benefits from planar adaptation.
