###Block: Aphorite Feats
Crystalline Cloud									CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREMULT:3,[PRERACE:1,Aphorite],[PRELEVEL:MIN=5],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Aphorite ~ Crystalline Dust]																																					DESC:You can release large amounts of crystalline dust to create a diversion or cover your allies.																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.14		BENEFIT:When you use your crystalline dust supernatural racial trait, you can instead create a cloud of crystalline dust in a 10-foot radius centered on you. The cloud does not obscure sight, but allies within the cloud receive the benefit of your crystalline dust. The cloud can be maintained each round as a free action as long as you remain within the cloud’s area. A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the cloud immediately. Each round that the crystalline cloud is active expends 2 rounds of your crystalline dust racial trait.			BENEFIT:Any creature with the chaotic subtype that enters the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or be sickened for 1 round.|(10+(TL/2)+CHA)|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Gilded Weapons

Gilded Weapons										CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREMULT:3,[PRERACE:1,Aphorite],[[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Aphorite ~ Crystalline Dust],[!PREALIGN:CG,CN,CE]																																			DESC:Axiomatic energies flow from the golden dust you shed, harming chaotic beings on contact.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.15		BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can expend 1 round of your crystalline dust ability to coat up to two of your natural weapons or held manufactured weapons in a layer of crystalline dust. The weapons remain coated for 1 round and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to creatures with the chaotic subtype. This extra damage does not stack with other features that add alignment-based damage to weapons, such as the axiomatic weapon special ability.
Reflexive Crystalline Dust							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREMULT:3,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Swift Crystalline Dust],[PRERACE:1,Aphorite],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Aphorite ~ Crystalline Dust]																												DESC:Vigilance has taught you to manifest your crystalline dust the instant you sense danger.

SOURCEPAGE:p.15		BENEFIT:You manipulate the runes and glyphs of your crystalline dust into an equation that describes a specific spell. This process is identical to scribing a scroll, except that the spell is stored as a specific pattern in your crystalline dust, visible only to you. You can activate the spell in the same way you would activate a scroll, except that you need only one hand free to trace the final glyph in the equation, releasing the spell. The cost of materials to store a spell equation is the same price as scribing an equivalent scroll. You can have one spell equation stored at a time, plus one additional spell when your character level reaches 10th, 15th, and 20th levels.
Spell Praxis										CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREMULT:4,[PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Scribe Scroll,Scribe Spell Equation],[PRERACE:1,Aphorite],[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Aphorite ~ Crystalline Dust]																		DESC:You can solve your spell equations in the instant your blade strikes a foe.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.15		BENEFIT:When you hit a creature with a melee weapon, you can immediately solve one of your spell equations to cast the spell and target that creature as an immediate action. The spell stored in the spell equation must be a spell of up to 3rd level that targets one or more creatures and has a casting time of 1 standard action. The spell can target only the creature you hit, even if the spell would normally allow multiple targets.
