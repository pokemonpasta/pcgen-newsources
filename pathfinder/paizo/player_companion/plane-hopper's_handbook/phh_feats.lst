SOURCEPAGE:p.14		BENEFIT:When you use your crystalline dust supernatural racial trait, you can instead create a cloud of crystalline dust in a 10-foot radius centered on you.

The cloud can be maintained each round as a free action as long as you remain within the cloud’s area. A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the cloud immediately. Each round that the crystalline cloud is active expends 2 rounds of your crystalline dust racial trait.			BENEFIT:Any creature with the chaotic subtype that enters the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or be sickened for 1 round.|(10+(TL/2)+CHA)|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Gilded Weapons

SOURCEPAGE:p.9		BENEFIT:When you use a monk weapon or unarmed strike to attack a creature that is casting a divine spell, the target is sickened for 1d4 rounds.

Willing Death										CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRERACE:1,Duskwalker																																																												DESC:You might have been a soldier in an army, a self-sacrificing lover, or a hero who rushed in where even angels feared to tread.
