###Block: Planar Protection Spells
Planar Aegis										CLASSES:Ranger=3|Occultist,Summoner=4|Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=5							SCHOOL:Abjuration			COMPS:V, S, M		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal						TARGETAREA:You												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds																								SOURCEPAGE:p.12						DESC:You draw motes of essence from material native to a plane that has elemental or energy essence traits, weaving the essence together into a shield of force. Choose an essence trait from the list below; the material component for this spell must come from a plane that has the essence trait you chose. Each essence trait has an associated damage type (see the table below). Any creature that hits you with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6+%1 points of damage of a type corresponding to the essence trait you chose. In addition, you take only half damage from attacks or effects of the associated damage type, and if such an attack or effect allows a saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.|min(CASTERLEVEL,20)																																					FACT:CompMaterial|(a fistful of naturally occuring material from a plane)
Speak With Plane									CLASSES:Medium,Summoner=3|Cleric,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=4							SCHOOL:Divination			COMPS:V, S, F/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One plane with a sentient structure				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes				SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.12						DESC:You tap into the awareness and consciousness of a plane with a sentient structure, allowing it to answer questions. A tangible manifestation of the plane (such as the ground) must be within the spell’s range upon casting. You can ask the sentient plane %1 question(s). If the plane’s alignment is at least one step away from yours, the plane can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A plane typically has a +20 bonus on Will saves, and a demiplane typically has a +15 bonus on Will saves. A plane’s traits can further affect these bonuses: a mildly aligned plane receives a +2 bonus, and a strongly aligned plane or a plane with the wild magic trait receives a +4 bonus on its save. If a plane has been subject to this spell within the past week, a new casting of this spell targeting the same plane fails. If speak with plane targets a plane that does not have a sentient structure, the spell fails.|(CASTERLEVEL/2)			FACT:CompMaterial|(a small glass bead)
