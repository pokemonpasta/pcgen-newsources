###Block: Planar Protection Spells
Planar Aegis														CLASSES:Ranger=3|Occultist,Summoner=4|Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=5							SCHOOL:Abjuration																						COMPS:V, S, M		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal						TARGETAREA:You																								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds																											SOURCEPAGE:p.12						DESC:You draw motes of essence from material native to a plane that has elemental or energy essence traits, weaving the essence together into a shield of force. Choose an essence trait from the list below; the material component for this spell must come from a plane that has the essence trait you chose. Each essence trait has an associated damage type (see the table below). Any creature that hits you with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6+%1 points of damage of a type corresponding to the essence trait you chose. In addition, you take only half damage from attacks or effects of the associated damage type, and if such an attack or effect allows a saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.|min(CASTERLEVEL,20)																																					FACT:CompMaterial|(a fistful of naturally occuring material from a plane)
Speak With Plane													CLASSES:Medium,Summoner=3|Cleric,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=4							SCHOOL:Divination																						COMPS:V, S, F/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One plane with a sentient structure																DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes							SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.12						DESC:You tap into the awareness and consciousness of a plane with a sentient structure, allowing it to answer questions. A tangible manifestation of the plane (such as the ground) must be within the spell’s range upon casting. You can ask the sentient plane %1 question(s). If the plane’s alignment is at least one step away from yours, the plane can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A plane typically has a +20 bonus on Will saves, and a demiplane typically has a +15 bonus on Will saves. A plane’s traits can further affect these bonuses: a mildly aligned plane receives a +2 bonus, and a strongly aligned plane or a plane with the wild magic trait receives a +4 bonus on its save. If a plane has been subject to this spell within the past week, a new casting of this spell targeting the same plane fails. If speak with plane targets a plane that does not have a sentient structure, the spell fails.|(CASTERLEVEL/2)			FACT:CompMaterial|(a small glass bead)
Talisman of Reprieve												CLASSES:Paladin=3|Inquisitor=4|Cleric=5													SCHOOL:Abjuration																						COMPS:V, S, DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius emanation centered on an item														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes																										SOURCEPAGE:p.12						DESC:You imbue an item with an aura of divine amnesty, allowing all allies within the aura’s area to ignore penalties to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks resulting from a plane’s mildly or strongly aligned traits, regardless of the allies’ alignments. In addition, the item grants a +4 circumstance bonus on checks with one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill determined by you at the time of casting.

Creatures with only neutral alignment components receive a +4 bonus on their Will saves against this spell. The penalties for alignment components stack (therefore, a chaotic evil spellcaster would take a –8 penalty).
Fiendish Wrath						PRERACE:1,Tiefling				CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Bloodrager,Mesmerist,Summoner=3|Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=4	SCHOOL:Enchantment			SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion			DESCRIPTOR:Emotion|Mind-Affecting			COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Medium						TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL/3) willing living creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart			DURATION:Concentration + (CASTERLEVEL) rounds			SAVEINFO:None										SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.13						DESC:Each affected creature flies into a combat frenzy. The target gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves.

If the target employs a spell or effect that heals itself or other creatures through the use of positive or negative energy, the target must succeed at a concentration check (DC = this spell’s save DC) or the effect restores only half of the normal number of hit points. Other forms of healing (such as from the Heal skill) are not affected by this spell.
